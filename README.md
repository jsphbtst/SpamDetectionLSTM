# SpamDetectionLSTM

This is Day 31 of my #100DaysOfCode journey. Here I implemented a simple LSTM model using Keras to detect whether a given text in an email is spam or not. The purpose was to just get used to how text analytics is done. Learning never stops!

The data here came from Shreyans Shrimal's GitHub. Check out his repo (https://github.com/shreyans29/thesemicolon) because it has a lot of cool stuff. Also check out his Youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/c/thesemicolon) it's pretty awesome.
